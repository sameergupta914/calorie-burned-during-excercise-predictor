# Calorie Burned During Exercise Predictor
# Overview
- The Calorie Burned During Exercise Predictor is a Python project aimed at providing users with an estimate of the calories burned during various types of exercises. The predictor takes into account the type of
  exercise, duration, intensity, and user-specific details such as weight, age, and gender to deliver accurate and personalized calorie burn estimates.

# Features:
- Supports Various Exercise Types: Calculate calorie burn for activities such as running, cycling, swimming, and more.
- Personalized Estimates: Input user-specific data like weight, age, and gender for tailored predictions.
- Intensity and Duration Adjustments: Adjust for different levels of exercise intensity (light, moderate, vigorous) and duration.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: Simple and intuitive code structure for easy integration and use.
- Real-Time Calculation: Immediate feedback on calorie burn based on the inputs provided.

# Technologies Used:
- Python for data processing and machine learning.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- Scikit-learn for building and deploying the predictive model.
- Flask for backend API development.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.
